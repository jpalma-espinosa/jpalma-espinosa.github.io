Greetings Human
===============

Hello!
I'm Javier, an electrical engineer / Scientist / Director of Photography from [Santiago de Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago).

I started this website because I thought it was the time for me to move all my thoughts, ideas and projects to the web. 
However, I will use this space to promote my work, share some tips and hints, and talk about my passion and future carreer: Neuroscience.


Overview
========

I got the big inspiration reading the great site of [Dr. Carl Boettinger](http://carlboettiger.info).  I somehow managed to 
build it with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 
I am still building this site, so please, do not expect, yet, a full implemented website, because there is still a lot to tweak.

The content of this site is my entire responsability, but the front-end is based on the great work done by Michael Rose and its 
[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) theme.
