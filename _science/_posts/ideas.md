This post must be updated, but some ideas to share content on this site:


1.- use Jupyter notebook to make my work
2.- use bokeh (http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) to generate the output
3.- use knitr(python based) to generate the marked up notebook<-- nope, use pandoc instead (actually, jupyter notebook can convert on the fly to .md)
4.- upload the static-rendered version of the document to this website
4.2.- try to implement an interactive plot stage within the jupyter notebook

check this https://demo.bokehplots.com/apps/gapminder
check out mbviewer.jupyter.org.  you can enter into an interactive mode with visualization
